![W3NFT Logo](https://w3nft.github.io/blockchain-beginnings/favicon.png)

W3NFT merges the cutting-edge realm of blockchain technology with the vibrant world of digital artistry. By leveraging Web3, we provide artists a unique platform to collaboratively create pixelated NFT art masterpieces. Join us on this journey as we revolutionize art ownership and authentication in the digital age.

## 🎨 Blockchain Beginnings

Our inaugural project, "Blockchain Beginnings", is a testament to the potential of collaborative art in the NFT space. Learn more [here](https://w3nft.github.io/blockchain-beginnings/).

## 🚀 Features

- **Pixel Signature**: Artists can pick a color, sign a pixel for only 0.01 ETH, and collaboratively design a pixelated art piece.
- **Smart Contract Enabled**: Our [smart contract](https://github.com/w3nft/blockchain-beginnings/blob/main/assets/assets/PixelContract.sol) ensures fairness and transparency. It selects lucky artists at random, with 70% of the revenue spent to purchase NFTs from selected artists, boosting their recognition.
- **OpenSea Auctions**: Finished arts are auctioned on OpenSea, starting from 10 ETH.
